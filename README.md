## core.io-persistence

[core.io][core.io] module to integrate [Waterline][wjs] into your applications.


### TODO
Currently we load models from a single directory. Ideally we want to be able to load models from core.io modules, i.e. core.io-passport should be able to register a `Passport` and a `PassportUser` models.
